# String Parsing Exercises
## Make a local clone of your fork
Make sure you're in your own fork before cloning!

## Create a file in this directory (`02-strings`)
*Complete these exercises the `02-strings` directory of this repository on your local machine.*

1. Create a file called `parse_strings.py`.
2. Create a variable called my_name and set it equal to your name. Turn your name into a list of letters using the  `.split()` method. 
3. Turn the string `"1,2,3,4,5"` into a list of integers. 
4. Turn the string `"One fish two fish red fish blue fish"` into a list that looks like `["one", "two", "red", "blue"]`
5. Create a function that calculates and returns a person’s grocery bill from this string:<br>
```str = “item:apples,quantity:4,price:1.50\n”```
  1. Modify this program to calculate a person’s total grocery bill from the list:<br>
  ```
	items = [“item:apples,quantity:4,price:1.50\n”, “item:pears,quantity:5,price:2.00\n”, “item:cereal,quantity:1,price:4.49\n”]
	```
6. Create a file called `guess_number.py` in this directory (`02-strings`). Inside the file, create a program that uses Python
to generate a random number between 1 and 10 and store it in a variable. Prompt the user to guess the number. 
If their guess is too high, print `"too high!"` And allow the user to guess again. If their guess is too low, print 
`"too low!"` And allow the user to guess again. If their guess is equal to the computer's number, print `"you win!"` 
And exit the program. 
  1.Modify this program to allow the user to pick the upper bound on the range for the game. <br>E.g. 1-50 instead of 1-10
7. Create a file called `pirate.py` in this directory (`02-strings`). Inside the file, write a program that asks the
user to type in a sentence and then print the sentence translated to pirate.
Here's a table of English to Pirate translations:
